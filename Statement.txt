You have to extend assignment 2 by adding java files for storing data.
For Example :When the user runs the program for the first time there are no accounts/no customer and  the user opens an account do set of operations and terminate the program the next time the user runs the program the program should have that account info.
This is one typical example. Same goes for customer info and other data in the assignment.
